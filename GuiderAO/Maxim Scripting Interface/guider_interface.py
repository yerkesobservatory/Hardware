"""
SBIG Guider SC-3 Command Line Interface
    To be used when operating the guider remotely through MaxIm DL

Included in the imports is the maxim_menu.py file which holds a library of python func's...
...built around the MaxIm DL proprietary scripting methods.

Using match/case (!!!a feature of Python 3.10 and later!!!) we can simulate a user...
...interface by continuously prompting the operator to execute a command. Until the...
...user has declined to execute another command, the session will be ongoing and the...
...MaxIm.Application Object will still be open.

Commands:
1. 'set' :establishes connection with the guider camera by initializing a ccd camera Object.

2. 'sever' :disconnects the guider camera by de-initializing the ccd camera Object.

3. 'expose' :takes a light exposure with the guider camera; how guide stars are found.
    - Takes a float value for duration as a parameter.

4. 'calibrate' :begins the calibration process in MaxIm DL. Should be done on device startup.
    - Takes a float value for duration (of each exposure) as a parameter.

5. 'calcode' :returns the present calibration code for the guider Object.
    - Decoding table can be found in the scripting manual.

6. 'stop' :instantaneously quits the guider's current task and returns the status to idle.

7. 'status' :returns the present status code for the ccd camera Object.
    - Decoding table can be found in scripting manual.

8. 'track' :begins the guide star tracking process in MaxIm DL. Guide star must alr be found.
    - The 'calibrate' and 'expose' commands must be done successfully before 'track'.
    - Takes a float value for duration (of each exposure) as a parameter.

9. 'starcoords' :returns the current coordinates of the acquired guide star.
    - If no guide star has been acquired, this shall return (0.0,0.0).

10. 'list' :prints the current list of operable commands to CLI

11. 'quit' :closes the interface as well as MaxIm DL by letting the loop complete.
