# Software Package for SEO Hardware

This repo contains software to operate the new components at Stone Edge Observatory.  Currently, this includes the filter wheel, the guider, and adaptive optics.   All software in this package is designed to run remotely with a Windows computer acting as a server, and a client computer that can be running any OS.  The filter wheel requires ASCOM COM packages that are only available in Windows, and the guider and adaptive optics software requires MaximDL.  To run this software, you need 2 TCP/IP ports- 1 for the filter wheel, and 1 for guider/AO.  Further details for the software for each component (Filter Wheel and Guider/AO) is provided in their respective READMES (Filter Wheel: /FilterWheelMover/FWM_README.md, Guider/AO: /Guider_AO/GAO_README.md).
